# Raspberry_Pi_Assignments

## Launch_Pad_Part_1

### **Assignment Description**

Our purpose is to lay the baseline of Pi in the sky. We are creating a countdown on the serial monitor from 10 to zero (liftoff). 

### **Evidence**

##### The image above shows the entire sequence of counting down from 10 to LIFTOFF. 

### **Wiring**

The only wiring for this assignment was to plug the pico into the computer.

### **Reflection**
This was a very simple and easy first assignment. Bringing in elements of what I had learned in previous years and simply a refresher on how to use variables and count down. There are many different ways to code this assignment and this is just one of them.

## Launch_Pad_Part_2

### **Assignment Description**

For this assignment we are told to add two LEDs to the previous assignment. Simply a red LED that blinks as the timer is counting down. Then a green LED that turns on and stays on once the countdown reaches zero. 
### **Evidence**

##### This wiring was very straightforward only using two leds and one resistor.

### **Code**

### **Reflection**

As this was a simple assignment there really was nothing that went wrong. I used a straightforward variable from the previous assignment and simply added the LED code where neccesary. The LEDs did not blink exactly on time the first upload but tweaking the time.sleep in the code fixed that. 

## Launch_Pad_Part_3

### **Assignment Description**

For this assignment we are still building on the previous two assignments of the Launch Pad sequence. In this assignment we are attempting to add a button to start the launch sequence. A relatively simple assignment with little added wiring as we are coding in circuitpython. 

### **Evidence**

##### Very straightforward wiring for this assignment.

### **Code**

### **Reflection**
This assignment was not much more difficult than the previous. Simply adding a button to start the entire "if" statement. It was all things that we have done in the past however a good refresher on some simple coding. The only issue I ran into was telling the pico that the button was being continuously pressed instead of having to hold it. Attaching a variable to the button was a simple way of doing this. 


## Launch_Pad_Part_4

### **Description**
For this assignment in the launchpad series we are tasked to add a servo to our launch system. When the countdown reaches zero, rotate the servo 180 degrees. This is all in all a simple assignment and only requires initializing a servo and then turning it on time.

### **Reflection**
This assignment was a little bit more difficult for me but still very very straightforward. When I say difficult it maybe took me three more minutes than the previous. These are all very helpful assignments to relearn the basics of code. This is the final launchpad assignment as well.

## Crash_Introduction_Part_1 

### **Description**
For this assignment we needed to simply wire an accelerometer and then print the values that come out of that accelerometer. This was a relatively straightforward assignment.

### **Code**

### **Reflection**
This assignment was the first that used some different language I had not known yet. As this was a new piece of equipment this was a harder assignment but still very straightforward. I used the f string to print the variables and another print of a blank space to seperate them for readability. As this was only an assignment printing something to the serial monitor it was relatively easy.

## Crash_Avoidance_Part_2
### **Description**
For this assignment we were building on the previous and simply adding an LED that turns on when the board is turned to 90 degrees. As well as adding a battery that powers the board so it can be disconnected from the board.

### **Reflection**
While I did fry a board in the pursuit of education during this assignment (RIP 2022-2023). This was a fun assignment to complete and the wiring was very straightforward. The code as well was a total of about 4 lines added onto the end of the last assignment. Simply looking at the values and turning the LED on. The fun part was wiring the LIPO to the pico and then having a mobile board for the first time. That was satisfying to see. 

## Crash_Avoidance_Part_3
### **Description**
This assignment builds on the previous in taking the velocities and acceleration from the accelerometer. Along with an led to indicate 90 degrees. Added onto this by an oled that displays the angular velocity constantly. 

### **Evidence**

### **Reflection** 
This was the final assignment in the crash avoidance progression. Overall I found this group of assignments very exciting as we were learning the ropes to new technology. This assignment with the oled gave me some particular issues with the code and initialization. The syntax for the oled is quite extensive to print certain things and it can be difficult. I ended up getting some hints from Graham as to a certain line that helped me to be able to display my rotation. Other than that the wiring was very straight forward and did not take that long to figure it out. 

## FEA Beam

### Assignment Description
For this assignment we needed to design a beam to hold the most weight possible. The beam fails if it either bends over 35 mm or breaks. The requirements are as follows.
* The beam must use the provided attachment block with no modifications. 
* The beam with the attachment block must be able to fully engage with the holder
* The beam must use the example eye bolt mounting geometry
* The center of the eyebolt hole must be 180 mm from the front face of the attachment block (in a direction perpendicular to the front face)
* No part of the beam may extend below the bottom face of the attachment block
* All vertical angles must be >= 45Â° measured relative to the horizontal plane (no overhangs)
* The beam must be PLA material
* **The entire beam, including attachment block, must weigh <= 13 grams**

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!

## FEA Beam V.2

### Description
We are told to run simulation tests on our original beam pictured above. Judging on how it performs we will then adjust the design of our beam as it requires and continue to test. This is all the process of testing and tweaking. The same criteria apply for the above assignment.

##### Simulation of the displacement

### Reflection
After testing our beams using the simulation feature in onshape. We were tasked with changing and altering the design to improve the effectiveness of the beam. However the altering is covered in the next part of this assignment. To learn the simulation in Onshape we used an Onshape tutorial that worked through the whole process. This really helped us understand how to utilize the simulation to get the results needed. These results are what help us improve on our desigh in the nect part of this assignment.
